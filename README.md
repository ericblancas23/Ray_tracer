# Ray_tracer
A rough draft and also real implementation of an animation technique called ray tracer. This project was inspired by Brady's article on how he got a job at Pixar. One of his first steps of getting noticed by pixar was by making some ray tracers and I decided to give myself a self study of programming animations and techniques using C++.
